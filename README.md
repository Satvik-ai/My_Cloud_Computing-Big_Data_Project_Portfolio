# ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Computing & Big Data Portfolio

Welcome! This portfolio showcases my hands-on projects in cloud computing and big data analytics using technologies like **Apache Spark**, **Kafka**, **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, and **real-time streaming architectures**. These projects demonstrate my ability to design, build, and deploy scalable cloud-native data solutions.

| üöÄ Project | üìÑ Description |
------------- | -------------
[Stock Anomaly Detection System](https://github.com/Satvik-ai/GCP_Stock_Anomaly_Detection_System) | Detects anomalies in live stock price streams using **Apache Kafka** and **Spark Streaming** with alerting logic.
[Real-time Image Classification](https://github.com/Satvik-ai/GCP_Real-time_Image_Classification) | Classifies images uploaded to a GCS bucket in real-time using a GCP VM and a pre-trained deep learning model.
[Digit Classification with Spark MLlib](https://github.com/Satvik-ai/GCP_Spark-MLlib) | 	Trains a decision tree model on handwritten digit data using **Spark MLlib** in a distributed environment.
[Streaming Row Counter (Kafka + Spark)](https://github.com/Satvik-ai/GCP_Real-time_Streaming_Application_Using_Kafka_And_Spark-Streaming) | Real-time line counting system using **Kafka producers** and **Spark Streaming consumers**.
[Row Counter via Cloud Functions + Pub/Sub](https://github.com/Satvik-ai/GCP_Real-time_Count_Lines_Using_Cloud_Functions_Pub-Sub) | Serverless app that counts file lines using **Cloud Functions**, **GCS triggers**, and **Pub/Sub**.
[SCD Type-II - SparkSQL](https://github.com/Satvik-ai/GCP_SparkSQL_SCD_Type-II) | Implements Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) Type-II logic using **Spark SQL** on customer master data.
[SCD Type-II - PySpark](https://github.com/Satvik-ai/GCP_Spark_SCD_Type-II) | Similar to the above but written purely in **PySpark DataFrame API** without SparkSQL.
[Spark Click Counter](https://github.com/Satvik-ai/GCP_Spark_Count_Clicks) |  A Spark code for finding the number of users clicks between 0-6 hr, 6-12 hr, 12-18 hr, and 18-24 hr using hashing-based methodology.
[Cloud Function based Line Counter](https://github.com/Satvik-ai/GCP_Cloud_Functions_Count_Lines) | A Python program to count the lines of a file that is placed in Google Cloud Storage bucket using Google Cloud Functions.
[VM-based Line Counter](https://github.com/Satvik-ai/GCP_VM_Count_lines) | Deployed a Virtual Machine on GCP and wrote a Python program to count lines of a file placed in GCS bucket.
